## Finance Calculators and Chart Generators

This is a project I started during a Finance class (FIN200) at my university (UQAR)

We had a problem in which we needed to analyse 5 investment opportunities for a company. After the analysis we had to draw a chart to support our results. It was a lot harder to do than I initially thought because of all the informations that needed to be included.

I initially did the chart manually with d3js but then I decided to create a chart generator out of it that I could share to hopefully help those that are looking for a solution for drawing this type of chart.

I will eventually add more finance related calculators and charting tools.

The first chart generator I build is available here:

This tool gives you a nice IOS overlapping with the company WACC and MCC
